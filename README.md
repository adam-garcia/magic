# "Magic" Number Guesser

Check out the demo [here](http://adam-garcia.github.io/magic)

Over dinner at my family's christmas party, a gift from one of the Christmas crackers was a magic trick. The materials consisted of a deck of 6 cards, each with 32 integers printed, as well as an instruction booklet outlining the process of the trick. First, the performer asks the participant to think of a number between 1 and 63. The cards in the deck are then shown to the participant, and the participant is asked to identify whether the card presented contained their number. After which the performer correctly guesses the participant's number by following the directions in the pamphelet.

This is just a really simple project for me to learn some basics of git/github, practice javascript, and play around a bit with the [skeleton framework](http://getskeleton.com/).

Things I'd like to play around with later: 

- Game Mechanics
	- Expanding the range
		- 1-63 isn't too big of a range &mdash; going to 255 or 511 might be fun
	- Removing "ruled out" numbers at each step
	- Changing the "guess" from an alert box to within-page
- Programming
	- restructuring/reworking js, css files
	- general UI changes
- Explanation
	- I'd really love to do a short write-up on how this trick works
