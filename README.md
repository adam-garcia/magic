# "Magic" Number Guesser

Over dinner at my family's christmas party, one of the gifts was a deck of 6 cards, each with 32 integers printed. First, the performer asks the participant to think of a number between 1 and 63. There were instructions to perform a magic trick wherein the performer correctly guesses the participants' "secret number" by asking if the number was on any, and which, of the cards in the deck. 

This is just a really simple project for me to practice git, js, and play around a bit with the [skeleton framework](http://getskeleton.com/).

Things I'd like to play around with later: 

- Game Mechanics
	- Expanding the range
		- 1-63 isn't too big of a range &mdash; going to 255 or 511 might be fun
	- Removing "ruled out" numbers at each step
	- Changing the "guess" from an alert box to within-page
- Programming
	- restructuring/reworking js, css files
	- general UI changes
